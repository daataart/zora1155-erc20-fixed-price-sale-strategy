- two erc20s, one for each tokenid in the same 1155 contract
if i create a zora1155 (address), can i 
set up a sale using one erc20 on address/[1]
and set up another sale using a second erc20 (say USDC) on address/[2]
and when other users buy address/[1] or address/[2], they get deducted the correct erc20



two erc20s, one for a address[1]/[1] and one for address[2]/[1] two different 1155 contracts

test funds recipient for mulitple sales, across multiple 1155 contracts and tokenIds

test_MintedPerRecipientGetter
test_ResetSale
test_fixedPriceSaleSupportsInterface

test multiple contract owners using the same strategy

i can set the limit per address to 0 on the eth side, stopping mints for eth, but still allowing mints for erc20s

bob's balance is reduced by token price multiplied by number minted
alice's balance is increased by token price multiplied by number minted (minus zora fee?)

test that the zora fee is deducted correctly
